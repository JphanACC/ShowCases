## User Story
The user will enter a social media platform where they can follow and like the other's user posts.<br> 
The platform allow what posts are trending and the user can have custom and organize their gallery inside their profile. <br>

## MVP Pitch
The MVP will contain a model for the user (with full authorization) and the posts. Each user can have many posts, and each post can contain text content and either an image, video URL or sketchfab URL to share their art/video URL from their other favorite platform. <br>

The user can: <br>
    1. edit their profile (email address, individual posts). <br>
    2. follow other artists (have their own follow sidebar). <br>
    3. read other artists' posts and their gallery. <br>
    4. go to their own gallery (which are their posts) and edit/delete them. 
    5. see the number and see the followers and following other users. <br>

The app can:
    1. allow user to close trending panel, which shows most liked posts in descending order.
